# Bulk File Renamer

This Python script renames all files in a specified directory in bulk.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

Here's how to use the script:

1. Run the script using the command python main.py.
2. When prompted, input the full path of the target directory.
3. Press enter to begin the renaming process.
4. The script will then rename all files in the directory and log the changes in log.csv.
